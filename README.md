## Introduction

**RISC-V Basic Hypervisor** is a university project aimed at simulating a hypervisor for the RISC-V architecture. A hypervisor, or virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software that enables the creation and management of virtual machines by abstracting the underlying hardware.

This project focuses on implementing a basic hypervisor functionalities for the open-source RISC-V architecture.
